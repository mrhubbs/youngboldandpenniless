Dear Wounded Catholic,

I spent a lot of time reflecting after a conversation with a family member. I decided to write a long-form response. I awoke in the night with my mind racing about everything and I can't get back to sleep. It would be an exaggeration to say that I awoke from the force of my thoughts, though, as I had two children piled on top of me<!--more-->. One had been fetched to nurse, finished, and was fidgeting. The other had migrated from his own room for help getting back to sleep.

My perspective on the crisis in the Church is shaped by three main things, but first:

**Preamble:** I know the Church is in crisis. I've known it as long as I can remember. The more I know, and the more the crisis develops, the more dire it seems. You know I love orthodox teaching, the traditions of the Church, and reverent liturgy. I have my share of liturgical horror stories and Eucharistic abuse stories. There was the time Fr. W flipped over his uncleansed Chalice to show the congregation the inscription on the bottom, at the close of Mass. He dropped Christ's blood on the floor. I was serving, saw it happening, and probably could have caught Him. (I didn't act out of fear, God forgive me.) There was the time I thought I saw a priest drop a host by the altar, after consecration, at college. I went up to look around after Mass. The priest came back from talking to people, bent down, picked up the host (he knew where it was), looked at me, and said "this one got away." There was the time, in 2014, I knelt to receive Communion on the tongue at a parish and the priest had me get up. After he gave me Jesus he told me I didn't have to, shouldn't, receive that way. He was misguidedly applying a Vatican directive that had been rescinded in 2011.

But I digress a bit. So many Catholics who care about relationship with God have left. So many who remain seem to be perishing of lukewarmness. We are so confused about marriage. There are far too many hirelings and wolves in shepherd's clothing. (Although I must be careful about my intentions when saying this. If the filth of the individuals occupying the offices make me despise the offices just a little, then Satan is gaining a foothold in me, for the offices are Divinely instituted.) And on and on. I recently read quotations from the Vatican newspaper's eulogies for David Bowie and Michael Jackson. They made me sick. Yes, the Church is in dire crisis.

Now to the three main things I want to share with you.

**I.**

In this time of crisis, all of us have been wounded to some extent by those who should be leading us to Jesus, in holiness. Wounds can be glorified in Christ, but they are not good if left untreated, because they weaken us and provide footholds for the Evil One. If you are very wounded and very upset, that is entirely legitimate. And of course you should be! Have you taken those wounds to Jesus? Have you taken them to prayer? Have you asked Him to heal them?

**II.**

This is a simple point, but I have a great many examples running through my head. I was reading Chesterton a few months ago and he said the Church has been close to dying many times. It has been old and dried out, when suddenly the younger generation rose up in the springtime of orthodox faith and the fire of the Holy Spirit. He said this happened with the First Crusade. Apparently, it was becoming common in Europe for people to believe they would become Muslims in the future. They had given up. It was primarily the young men, at the call of the Pope, who rose up and roared "NO!" Chesterton saw this happening in his own lifetime. I see it happening in mine.

I don't know what your primary touch points with Catholicism are. Maybe your parish is vibrant, maybe it is not. Maybe your Catholic friends and family and acquaintances are on fire, maybe they are not. Maybe you read a lot about Church politics. I'm sure you are aware that there is a resurgence of faith and orthodoxy among my generation. Let me tell you, as I reflect on it, it feels like a tidal wave or like the army of tree-ents in the Two Towers. I have so many friends who desire to be fully faithful to the Church, who seek Christ in personal prayer and the Eucharist, who love Latin Mass or - at the least - seek out reverent celebrations of the liturgy, who seek out holy, orthodox priests who are in love with Christ in the Eucharist and educate their flocks in spiritual warfare. These friends have other friends, entire communities. Through social media Chloe follows faithful Catholic bloggers throughout the country, who also have entire networks of Catholic friends. We listen to a podcast by a community of parish priests in the Denver area who are connected to, and leading, a thriving Catholic community. I could go on, but suffice it to say there is a growing army of Catholics in their mid-thirties and younger who remind me precisely of those orthodox, faithful crusaders. What this army is like, I'll circle back to.

Other than my parents' example, and some of the books I read, the most impactful thing on my formation in the faith was going on Catholic Youth Expeditions. There I was exposed to young adults who were personally seeking Christ's Will in their lives. They were teaching high schoolers the liturgy of the hours, how to pray in Adoration, the Rosary, Scripture, to encounter Christ in nature, in communion with each other, but above all in the Eucharist and in reverent celebration of the Mass. Leading it all was a wacky business-student-turned-priest who'd been inspired by Pope John Paul II, and had quotes from said pontiff plastered all over his vehicle. Though my parents gave me such a good foundation, if I hadn't had those examples from other Catholics my faith would be nothing like it is today. I can trace so much of my life in the faith right to John Paul II. The same is true of so, so many of my friends, Catholic speakers I listen to, etc.

And what is this army like, that the late Pope inspired? Equipped by him they can shine the bright light of Theology of the Body on the confusion and depravity we are swimming in. Following his example, they have the guts to consecrate every last scrap they own - and even the merits of their prayers and works - totally to Christ through His mother. They avail themselves of God's Ocean of Mercy, both in their own lives and on the whole world. JPII was not perfect, and he made mistakes and had faults. But when I look at his impact, the little bit that I can see, I wonder if Christ's words to Sister Faustina apply to him: "I bear a special love for Poland. If she will be faithful to me, from her shall come the spark that will prepare the world for my second coming."

The Church is in a bad way. It's really bad. But it is Christ's church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail. Already He is making all things new.

**III.**

We are called to be obedient to the Magisterium, who, as men, can be vague, silly, misleading and downright wretched. So how to we do that? I look to the example of St. Francis. The Magisterium in his day was no pantheon of Saints, yet St. Francis insisted on obedience in all things but sin. He even insisted on obedience in things that were not binding. He even insisted on obedience when the Magisterium chose to destroy some of the essential character of his order (St. Francis was insistent on absolute and complete poverty, the Church said that wasn't practical for an order.)

The thing is, God has placed people over us in authority. The spiritual tradition tells us the surest way to know we are being obedient to God us to be obedient to those in authority over us. It is especially an act of trust when we see the failings and sins of those in authority. We say, "God, you've put this person in authority over me, if they are going to seriously mislead me, then you need to remove this person." Of course this must all be done within reason! We can't blindly follow every detail of the example of those in authority over us. And in this time of crisis, we have to distance ourselves in some ways, to protect our souls. But, as a core attitude, this default of obedience is a lot safer than trying to forge our own path, even just a little. We maintain a trust in God and a thirst for unity. It prevents us from becoming separationist or bitter. It is, however, a lot more painful.

It is easier to be angry with the Pope. It is more painful to look at the Pope - doing and saying things that are vague, misleading, untrue, etc - and say "he is my spiritual father and I love him dearly." Keeping him closer to our hearts, he can hurt us deeper. It is a way of sharing in the sufferings of Christ, I think, Who keeps us so close to His heart that we can pierce it. It is part of being a family: it is your spouse, your children, your parents who can wound you the deepest.

**Conclusion**

In the face of the current crisis, particularly the weaknesses and sins of the shepherds, I am deeply sorrowful. It pierces me. But I am not perturbed. It is Christ's Church and I trust Jesus. He will always, always keep us safe, no matter what. And He is always, always making things new. In the wake of the scandal surrounding Cardinal McCarrick, 17 young men contacted the Archbishop of Cincinnati about entering the seminary. Each one of them had been feeling called to actively discern the priesthood, and each one of those men couldn't stand by any longer.

Love,
William

P.S.

We're on our third parochial vicar at our parish. Each of them is very much in love with Jesus and completely orthodox. Each one celebrates the Novus Ordo with great reverence and care. They teach us about traditions of the Church like the Ember Days. Our Parish doesn't do Latin Mass on the weekends, but they celebrate the Tridentine on weekdays and special occasions. Some of them wear cassocks instead of clerics. However, they aren't like some traditional Catholics I have encountered who seem to focus only on doing the Liturgy correctly. They reach out to their people. They foster community rooted in Christ. They know how to lovingly and understandingly talk to people who aren't faithful Catholics, without compromising the Truth of Christ. And I should say, all this goes for our pastor as well.
